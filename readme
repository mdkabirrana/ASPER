This is the implementation of ASPER paper. The main goal is to extract semantic pattern from sentences.
Any dataset exhibiting semantic relation is expected to have four columns.

1. X (First word or phrase)
2. Y (Second word or phrase)
3. Sentence exhibiting X and Y
4. Boolean (Does X and Y contain the desired semantic relation?)


To run the project run the following files sequentially.

1. AutomaticPatternRecognition.py
It is expected that the dataset file will be under "dataset" folder.

2. ItemsetMiningOnAttention.py
Run this file to extract semantic patterns
